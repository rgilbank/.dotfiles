    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install

my setup
--------
- Vim +vundle +airline +vim-coffee-script +syntastic +supertab
- Zsh +oh-my-zsh

notes
-----

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will be added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.

- **topic/\*.sh**: Any files ending in `.sh` get loaded into your environment.

- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. (These files get symlinked when you run `rake install`.)

  - symlinks can be generated in cases where these standard **topic/\*.symlink**
  symlink rules do not apply; see the `:install` task of the `Rakefile` for details.

- **.localrc**: Create a file called `.localrc` to store any data that you do
  not want committed to the git repository (secrets, etc.).
